# TodoList-App-React
In this project, I utilized React to create a Todo list application where users can add, edit, update, and delete tasks. The app allows users to input a title and description for each task, which are then displayed in a list format. Editing, updating, and deleting operations are seamlessly integrated to provide a smooth user experience.
